As every experienced backcountry adventurer knows, possessing solid tools for navigation is one of the Ten Essentials for a safe adventure. There are, of course, many technological options out there, but to truly be prepared there’s really nothing better than a paper map--and there’s absolutely no better map than a color topographic Green Trails map. Fully vetted and high quality, Green Trails maps are not only useful for trip planning but will keep backcountry travelers on track, long after the batteries have died on other navigational devices.

Each map includes:
Trails coded for hikers only, as well as mountain bikers, stock, skiers, and snowmobilers
Icons for parking and picnic areas, tent camping and RV spaces, bathrooms and backcountry toilets, points of interest, waterfalls, springs, and gates
Dot-to-dot trail distances, contour intervals, adjacent map numbers, and permits required

99S,https://www.mountaineers.org/books/books/olympic-coast-beaches-wa-no-99s-green-trails-maps,"Washington’s Olympic Coast contains some of the wildest beaches and the largest roadless coastal strip remaining in the continental United States. And while good parts of this remote, windswept, and rain-drenched coastline require difficult headland trails (many with ropes and sand ladders) to reach; a fair amount of this country is relatively easily accessible. Map 99S covers the entire coastline from the Queets River to Cape Flattery. This map complete with headland tide crossing information as well backcountry campsites is an essential for planning your Olympic Coast backpacking adventure. Map 99S also includes the dog-friendly stretch of coast near Kalaloch; and Ruby Beach, La Push, Rialto Beach, Ozette Lake, Shi Shi Beach and Cape Flattery Trail on the Makah Reservation.

But there is so much more to Rattlesnake Mountain than the 2 mile trail to its famous ledges. The highest of the Issaquah Alps topping in at over 3500-feet, Rattlesnake contains more than ten miles of other trails leading to sweeping views, quiet forests, and a couple of summits. Our 205S map includes the entire mountain as well as the adjacent Raging River State Forest. This map also displays the upper Snoqualmie Valley Trail from Rattlesnake Lake to Fall City, Cedar Butte, Twin Falls Natural Area, Meadowbrook Farm, Tollgate Farm, the eastern half of the Preston-Snoqualmie Trail and the community trails on Snoqualmie Ridge.
